When their food arrives, Sarah notices that her salmon appears overcooked and dry. The vegetables look wilted and cold. She decides to speak with the waiter politely about the issue.\n\n'Excuse me,' Sarah says to the waiter. 'I'm sorry to bother you, but I think there might be an issue with my salmon. It seems quite overcooked and the vegetables appear to be cold. Would it be possible to have this replaced?'\n\nThe waiter apologizes sincerely and offers to bring a fresh dish immediately. He also mentions that the chef would like to offer a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience. Sarah appreciates the professional response and thanks the staff for their understanding.",
